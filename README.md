Java program created in data structures course. 

This program is the implementation of the Magic Square Algorithm 
A magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A magic square contains the integers from 1 to n2. 
The constant sum in every row, column and diagonal are called the magic constant or magic sum, M. The magic constant of a normal magic square depends only on n and has the following value:
